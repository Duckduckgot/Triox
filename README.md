## Why Triox?

‚òòÔ∏è **Open Source** - We strongly believe in collaboration and
transparency.

‚ö° **Speed** - Get the most out of your hardware! Triox runs fast, even
on weak hardware.

üîí **Security** - We're using state-of-the-art algorithms and
authentication methods to protect your data.

‚õìÔ∏è **Reliability** - Built on top of the strong guarantees of the [Rust
programming language](https://rust-lang.org).

üõ´ **Easy Setup** - Triox comes with batteries included and is easy to
configure.

## Features

Triox is still in an early stage but is already usable. The features
we'd like to add before our first release can be found in [this
issue](https://github.com/Trioxidation/Triox/issues/17).

## Demo

### Hosted server

~~Sign in with username `demo_user` and password `demo_password`.~~

~~Sadly, we can't allow users to upload files due to legal restrictions.
Since we can't guarantee that no illegal data will be uploaded the demo
server runs in read-only mode.~~

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Trioxidation/triox && cd triox
```

2. Build and start Triox

```bash

```

Triox should be accessible at http://localhost:3000
